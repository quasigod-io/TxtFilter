# TxtFilter
Filters out any lines in common between two text documents.

Place a txt file titled filter.txt in the txtFilter/bin/debug. This file should have the lines you want removed.

Place a txt file titled main.txt in the same folder. This file should be the one you want lines removed from.

In case anyone is wondering why I would create such a niche software, I use it for seperating packages installed by default on linux distributions and the ones I installed myself.
